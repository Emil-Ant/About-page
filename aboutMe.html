            <h2>Some times I got paid to do things</h2>
            <h3>Intern at CYENS</h3>
            <p>
                My year-long internship introduced me to the complicated world of timesheets in public research ogranizations. There were many factors to consider and many people to speak with. During it, I actually coded a very small and simple Python script that would automate the data checking  I had to do on Microsoft Excel. For the first time this made me feel like I finally "got" programming, I sort of finally quit the endless loop of tutorials and courses. Above that, I also interacted with programmers every single day, which I believe inspired me to finally pursue programming more. 
            </p>
            <h3>Research Executive</h3>
            <p>
                For about 7 months I managed several projects for a boutique (fancy word for small) market research company in Cyprus. It was sort of a "life" bootcamp, which was very challenging. It taught me several lessons on what I want from a career and how to manage my time at and outside of work. Above that, I also learned how to work with several stakeholders and suppliers all at once. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I was managing suppliers to make us things and adjust elements (no pun intended) of our website and I really would have rather have done what they did than manage it. The only real day of work that I felt fly by was the day I had to program and survey using if and else logic. 
            </p>
            <h3>Manual Labour</h3>
            <p>
                I have always worked with my dad on and off throughout my life. I am including this in "Things I got paid to do" because working alongside him when I could helped us provide for the rest of the family (he also always tries to pay me for it). There is no real way of sugar-coating it: it was work on roofs in the harsh Cypriot sun in the summer. This is by far my favourite experience. It taught me about the priviledge I have and how hard my parents had to work for me to get it. It taught me about my dad's permanent t-shirt shaped tan from spending hours in the sun. Finally, it made me realise that despite all that my parents never complained, in fact laughed and smiled more than most people I have met.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>"Early Years"</h3>
            <p>
                I am half Lebanese, half Cypriot. I grew up at the heart of the capital (Nicosia) of a small
                mediterranean country called Cyprus <b>(The last divided capital of Europe)</b>. Growing up at the heart of a geopolitical conflict is trully unique and the experience pushed me to build a better personal and communal identity.
            </p>
            <h3>University</h3>
            <p>
                Following a challenging year doing a mandatory 14 month army conscription, I decided to attend the
                University of Nottingham to pursue a Bsc in Industrial Economics. During this degree I learned alot
                about market economics as well as competition economics. Alot of concepts like the Hotelling model of spatial economics. Interstingly, I also chose to <em>stay in and learn basic HTML</em> for the first time rather than participating in fresher's events.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming / Education v2.0</h3>
            <p>
                Programming is always something I have wanted to pursue but the "mathematics" behind them always intimidated me. As many people believe, I always thought it just simply was for people with a pre-determined ability or skill. All I knew beforehand was SQL from a module at University and <b>very</b> basic HTML with some CSS. Living with an immunocompromised mother during much of the pandemic, I limited my physical interactions as much as I could. This resulted in <b>lots</b> of spare time: so I decided to learn Python. It took me quite some time to be able to grasp alot of it, until I started realising that programming books actually helped me more than anything in learning. I have lots of programming books I want to get into when I have more time. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I was enjoying it but at times I did not feel like I was learning anything, until one day where I had a conversation with a friend of mine. A person that also thought programming would not fit them, until they attended <i lang="fr">Ã‰cole 42</i>. They not only changed my perception of programming but also introduced me to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>. For the first time I felt like I was making progress. I then started considering a bachelors, but I wanted to build things, solve problems, faster than another bachelors would. For that reason I choice to enrol at University College Cork for a higher diploma in Applied Computing.
