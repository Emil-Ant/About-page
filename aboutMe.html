            <h2>Some times I got paid to do things</h2>
            <h3>Intern at CYENS</h3>
            <p>
                My year-long internship introduced me to the complicated world of timesheets in public research ogranizations. There were many factors to consider and many people to speak with. During it, I actually coded a very small and simple Python script that would automate the data checking  I had to do on Microsoft Excel. For the first time this made me feel like I finally "got" programming, I sort of finally quit the endless loop of tutorials and courses. Above that, I also interacted with programmers every single day, which I believe inspired me to finally pursue programming more. 
            </p>
            <h3>Research Executive</h3>
            <p>
                For about 7 months I managed several projects for a boutique (fancy word for small) market research company in Cyprus. It was sort of a "life" bootcamp, which was very challenging. It taught me several lessons on what I want from a career and how to manage my time at and outside of work. Above that, I also learned how to work with several stakeholders and suppliers all at once.

        <section class="Education">
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <h3>University</h3>
            <p>
                Following a challenging year doing a mandatory 14 month army conscription, I decided to attend the
                University of Nottingham to pursue a Bsc in Industrial Economics. During this degree I learned alot
                about market economics as well as competition economics. Alot of concepts like the Hotelling model of spatial economics.
            </p>
            <h3>Programming / Education v2.0</h3>
            <p>
                I was enjoying it but at times I did not feel like I was learning anything, until one day where I had a conversation with a friend of mine. A person that also thought programming would not fit them, until they attended <i lang="fr">Ã‰cole 42</i>. They not only changed my perception of programming but also introduced me to <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">The Odin Project</a>. For the first time I felt like I was making progress. I then started considering a bachelors, but I wanted to build things, solve problems, faster than another bachelors would. For that reason I choice to enrol at University College Cork for a higher diploma.
